### Question to investigate:
Drug Overdose incidents are a serious public health problem, and knowing the number of incidents each year, their regional distribution and the types of drugs used can help us better understand the nature of the problem and develop effective prevention strategies which could range from advertisements to laws.
(Investigate fentanyl, drug classification T40.4)

### Relevance:
With recent advertisements and news outlets mentioning more and more about fentanyl use, the question is, how impactful is fentanyl in our country? How many people are affected by it today? How was the problem in years prior? What was the prevalence in different demographic and geographic regions?

### What is known:
According to the CDC*:
Fentanyl is 100x stronger than morphine
Fentanyl is added to other drugs because of its extreme potency
Recent cases are from illegally made fentanyl
Deadly even in small doses

### Data Sets:

### Visuals: 
Bar graph of Drug Overdose death vs year (refer to data set 1)
Bar graph of the percentage of drug overdose death in terms of overall death vs year (refer to data set 1)
Bar graph of the multiple drugs' death vs year (refer to data set 2)
Percentage of different gender of drug poisoning death (refer to data set 2)
Percentage of drug poisoning death in terms of overall drug poisoning death by age group (refer to data set 2)

### Timeline:
We will split into two groups to manage and work on data sets 1 and 2. Both groups are still collaborating and communicating together, but this ensures responsibility for sections of the work. Each group can split their work between team members if agreed upon by the entire group.


#### Group 1: Data set 1 | Drew Lara, Oscar Wu, Yuxiang Chen

	Have all data graphics completed → Saturday, 9 March 2024


#### Group 2: Data set 2 | Xiangwei Huang, Dingye Chen
	Have all data files converted to an organized array → Saturday, 24 February 2024
	Have all data graphics completed → Saturday, 9 March 2024

#### Both groups:
Have Slides Ready → Saturday 16 March 2024
